** A tool to annotate texts. **

There are already several other annotation tools out there but none
of them really matched my requirements. Hence, I created my own.

Run
    python neanno.py -h

from the commandline or check neanno.py to see how the
annotate_entities() function can be used.

Feel free to use but don't blame me if things go wrong.
