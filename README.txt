====================================

** A tool to annotate texts. **

There are already several other annotation tools out there but none
of them really matched my requirements. Hence, I created my own.

Run
    python neanno.py -h (if in source directory)
or
    python -m neanno -h (if package is installed)

from the commandline to get more details.

Feel free to use but don't blame me if things go wrong.
