** Yet another named entity annotation tool. **

"neanno" is a tool and Python function to annotate named entities.

There are already several other annotation tools out there but none
of them really matched my requirements. Hence, I created my own.

What stands out from other annotation tools is that entities can be
annotated with single shortcuts. Also, in future there will likely
be and active learning feature which will help reduce the number of
texts that have to be annotated.

Run
    python neanno.py -h

from the commandline or check neanno.py to see how the
annotate_entities() function can be used.

Feel free to use but don't blame me if things go wrong.
